"[Killing Floor 2 stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GDpg2mN1l_86U_RaDug0glFx8cZCuErwxZLiBKl9SyY/edit#gid=2068776317)" commonly referred to as The KF2 Bible, is the ultimate respository of Killing Floor 2 mechanics.
The KF2 Bible has information ranging from how Afflictions work, to weapon stats and numbers, to ZED spawning/despawning mechanics.
It is actively being maintained by SimpleCat (bless this man).

With the extraordinary amount of information the KF2 Bible has, this project's primary goal is to make looking at numbers and information more digestible both in visuals and in text.
Secondarily, this project will also provide damage calculation tools for both casual and hardcore KF2 players.
